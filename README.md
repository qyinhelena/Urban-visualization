# Equity Analysis of CA Electric Vehicle Public Charging Infrastructure
Authors: Yin Qiu, Wenqi Luo

The equity analysis is part of the capstone project at UC Berkeley Master program. The results of equity analysis were presented as visualization (created by tableau) on the GEAR Capstone Website https://alison626k.github.io/MIMS21-GEAR/ , in section 2 of equity analysis.

Yin Qiu contributed to the initial probing of charging station and scale mapping to understand the basic EV charger distribution, which set a stepping stone for equity analysis.

Wenqi Luo contributed to equity analysis by integrating EV charger data, census data, EV registration data and CalEnvrionScreen Score data.
